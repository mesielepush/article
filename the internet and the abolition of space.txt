y cuando por fin me sentí comodo con las técnicas y los lenguajes, me di cuenta de que mi ambiente no tiene 


lets say we pass from been conected by the power line and therefore submited to space, 


we do this work with pure lenguaje aboiding some of natural needs of space.



the communication of our species is always limited by space, it´s safe to assume that trough the centuries we were always been trying to overcome that necessity. We use sound and visual signals that amplify or field or we use animals to carry the message, however it is, it wasn't until we learn to use electricity that we became efficent at it. That happened at the last part of the 19th century, and it took us 10,000 years to get there. And that, for better or worst tranformed the face of the earth, now humans could grow exponentialy. 
We became suited for many types of climage, we learn to produce massives amounts of food, we control child mortality and we get to the closest we have been in 10 millenia to control nature. 
More specificly for this topic we found better ways to store knoledge with the guttemberg printing machine, which in turn cause a massive push for the development of science and new techniques,



This alowed us to grow bigger,

is the visual editors the ones that should be talking with the internet, not trought a transletion to html protocol, but a new protocol, some especie of multidimentional-pure-svg lenguaje, in which we can code thinking from spaces and not from the element-especific-placement of html. The main protocol for internet comunication should be design on the basis of visuals, that is to say that primarly shoud be coding some kind of topografic data, close to a game engine.
