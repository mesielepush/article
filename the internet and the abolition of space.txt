lets say we pass from been conected by the power line and therefore submited to space, 


we do this work with pure lenguaje aboiding some of natural needs of space.



the communication of our species is always limited by space, it´s safe to assume that trough the centuries we were always trying to overcome that necessity. We use sound and visual signals that amplify or field or we use animals to carry the message,
and altough we found better ways to store knoledge with the guttemberg printing machine, which in turn cause a massive push for the development of science and new techniques, we were still subedited to the inherint space of the book, and the distance that the book have to travel to get to the readers.

It wasn't until we learn to use electricity that we became efficent at it. That happened at the last part of the 19th century, and it took us 10,000 years to get there. And electricity, for better or worst tranformed the face of the earth. Now  
We became suited for many types of climage, we learn to produce massives amounts of food, we controled child mortality and we get to the closest we have been in 10 millenia to control nature. Now humans could grow exponentialy.

And of course we found better ways to store knoledge with the guttemberg printing machine, which in turn cause a massive push for the development of science and new techniques. but we were still subedited to the space of the book, 



This alowed us to grow bigger,

twenty years ago
is the visual editors the ones that should be talking with the internet, not trought a transletion to html protocol, but a new protocol, some especie of multidimentional-pure-svg lenguaje, in which we can code thinking from spaces and not from the element-especific-placement of html. The main protocol for internet comunication should be design on the basis of visuals, that is to say that primarly shoud be coding some kind of topografic data, close to a game engine.
