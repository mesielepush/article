The internet and the abolition of Space
History of computing could be seen as the systematic process to eliminate the necessity of space in the managing of data.
Thing is, the communication of our species has always been limited by space. It is safe to assume that trough the centuries we were always trying to overcome that necessity. We have used sound devices and visual signals that amplify our field of sight and the scope of our voices; we have codified our natural language and put those signs on walls or on paper so they can be reached by other humans. All of that, trough the message doing the traveling and not us, to overcome that distance.
We became good at it. It was easy for us to get from there to the Gutenberg printing machine, and by easy I mean: writing took us at least 60 thousand years, whereas from there to printed books it's just 4 thousand. 
The Gutenberg's machine begun the exponential spread of our species over the earth. And it did so, by first: eliminating the necessity of having the writer in the reach, to get the information or message or data. A necessity of course, that we humans had already left behind by handmade books. But now we were eliminating the necessity of the book maker, which occupies much more space than the final book. And then, with the space of just one machine, we could overcome the space of thousands, potentially millions, of book makers.
 I think is funny that the first book commercially printed were the catholic bible. It shows the scope of our sight at the time, since religious writing is the most general form of message that any human being can understand, followed close enough with child stories. 
Printing gave us the power to found new cities, and fill their inhabitants with the knowledge of remote times and far away lands. But we kept the necessity of space that inherits every book, and the space that needs to travel. Needless to say almost instantly in historical terms, we learn to control electricity. That happened at the last part of the 19th century, and it took us just 300 years from the Gutemberg machine.
For better or worst electricity gave us the last push. 
We became suited for many types of climates, we gain the ability to produce massive amounts of food, we controlled child mortality and we get to the closest we have been in at least 100 millennia to control nature. Humans begun to grow exponentially and therefore, a more efficient communication strategy was needed.
And what is better to push human ingenuity that war?
Granted, could be anything. But it  works just fine for the twentieth century. When because of it, we finally get rid of the necessary mechanical implementation of Mr Baggage, and achieve the ability to solve data that could lead immediately to win somebodies war. And now of course, the span of time between the first computer design to the first electronic  computer was less than one hundred years. 
We conquered the space needed to transform data.
How needs wood, metal or soil if you can just use atoms? ANd now, even tough we 


Now humans are stick together trough distance. We gain the new ability to at least say if there is or there is not a current, and now we knew something . 




 
and altough we found better ways to store knoledge with the guttemberg printing machine, which in turn cause a massive push for the development of science and new techniques, we were still subedited to the inherint space of the book, and therefore to the distance that the book has to travel to get to the readers.

lets say we pass from been conected by the power line and therefore submited to space, 


we do this work with pure lenguaje aboiding some of natural needs of space.



Communication of our species has always been limited by space, it´s safe to assume that trough the centuries we were always trying to overcome that necessity. We use sound and visual signals that amplify or field or we use animals to carry the message,
and altough we found better ways to store knoledge with the guttemberg printing machine, which in turn cause a massive push for the development of science and new techniques, we were still subedited to the inherint space of the book, and therefore to the distance that the book has to travel to get to the readers.

It wasn't until we learn to use electricity that we became efficent at getting information trought long distances. That happened at the last part of the 19th century, and it took us 10,000 years to get there. 
Electricity, for better or worst tranformed the face of the earth. 
We became suited for many types of climages, we were able to produce massives amounts of food, we controled child mortality and we get to the closest we have been in 10 millenia to control nature. Humans begun to grow exponentialy.

And this time in turn, was the growth of human units what allowed for the biggest explotion of development in science and techniques that any human have ever seen before, probably a more drastic evolution than what anyone could have been dreamed of. Everything in such a narrow range of time, that some people experience the whole way from the last comun telegraph to the smart phone.
the history of computing could be seen as the sistematic progress to eliminate the neccesity of space .
The baggage machine could not be contructed because of his mechanichal nature, it occupyed too much space, and some of the space that it should ocuppy were in need for pieces that we were simply not able to produce by then. 
World war 2 pushed the need to abandon mechanichal computing and gave birth to the firsts electronical computers, and altough by then computers still ocupyed a considerable space, less than 30 years later we had portable ones.




twenty years ago
is the visual editors the ones that should be talking with the internet, not trought a transletion to html protocol, but a new protocol, some especie of multidimentional-pure-svg lenguaje, in which we can code thinking from spaces and not from the element-especific-placement of html. The main protocol for internet comunication should be design on the basis of visuals, that is to say that primarly shoud be coding some kind of topografic data, close to a game engine.
