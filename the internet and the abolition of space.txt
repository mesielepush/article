The internet and the abolition of Space
History of computing could be seen as the systematic process to eliminate the necessity of space in the managing of data.
Thing is, the communication of our species has always been limited by space. It is safe to assume that trough the centuries we were always trying to overcome that necessity. We have used sound devices and visual signals that amplify our field of sight and the scope of our voices; we have codified our natural language and putted those signs on walls or on paper so they can be reached by other humans. We have found different ways for the message to do the traveling and not us.
And we became good at it. It was easy for us to get from writing to the Gutenberg printing machine, and by easy I mean: writing took us at least 60 thousand years, whereas from there to the printed book were just 4 thousand. 
The Gutenberg's machine begun the exponential spread of our species over the earth. And it did so, by first: eliminating the necessity of having the writers in the reach, which was necessary in order to get their information or message or data. A necessity that we humans had already left behind by handmade books. But now we were eliminating the necessity of the book maker, which occupies much more space than the final book. And then, with the space of just one machine, we could overcome the space of thousands, potentially millions, of book makers. And second: by reducing the time it took to produce each piece. And by time of course, I mean just another form to measure space. We just need to point the fact that humans say things like: 'my home it's 15 minutes away' and not 10 km away. So less time also means less space.
Printing gave us the power to found new cities, since now they were closer. Trough those books we could fill their inhabitants with the knowledge of remote times and far away lands. But we still  kept the necessity of space that inherits every book, and the space that the book needs to travel.
From there, almost instantly in historical terms, we took another big leap: we learn to control electricity. That happened at the last part of the 19th century, and it took us just three centuries from Gutenberg's machine. And for better or worst, electricity gave us the last push.
We became suited for many types of climates, we gain the ability to produce massive amounts of food, controlled child mortality and get to the closest we have been in at least 100 millennia to understand, predict and control nature. Humans begun to grow exponentially and therefore, a more efficient communication strategy was needed.
Lucky for us, demographic explosion translates to many more humans units working at the same time, which translates again to a lot of human units working on the same space, even though, they are separated by long distances. So in some sense, the problem to overcome the space between the units of an exponentially growing population was the fact that we had an exponentially growing sub-population working on those matters, so the problem kind of fixed itself. Well… with a little help of WWII course.
What is better to push human ingenuity than war? Granted, could be more things. But the statement  works just fine for the first half of the twentieth century. When because of it, we finally get rid of the necessary mechanical implementation of Mr Baggage, and achieve the ability to manipulate data that by electric means. And now, unsurprisingly, the span of time between the first computer design (when we were not even able to produce it), to the first electronic  computer just took us one hundred and thirty years.
We don't need the space of the book anymore, we can craft them with electricity. And maybe more importantly, with electronic computers we conquered the space needed to transform data. How needs wood, metal or soil when you can just use atoms?
Next logical step was to eliminate the distance between computers and less than 30 year later the internet was borne.

lets say we pass from been conected by the power line and therefore submited to space, 


we do this work with pure lenguaje aboiding some of natural needs of space.



Communication of our species has always been limited by space, it´s safe to assume that trough the centuries we were always trying to overcome that necessity. We use sound and visual signals that amplify or field or we use animals to carry the message,
and altough we found better ways to store knoledge with the guttemberg printing machine, which in turn cause a massive push for the development of science and new techniques, we were still subedited to the inherint space of the book, and therefore to the distance that the book has to travel to get to the readers.

It wasn't until we learn to use electricity that we became efficent at getting information trought long distances. That happened at the last part of the 19th century, and it took us 10,000 years to get there. 
Electricity, for better or worst tranformed the face of the earth. 
We became suited for many types of climages, we were able to produce massives amounts of food, we controled child mortality and we get to the closest we have been in 10 millenia to control nature. Humans begun to grow exponentialy.

And this time in turn, was the growth of human units what allowed for the biggest explotion of development in science and techniques that any human have ever seen before, probably a more drastic evolution than what anyone could have been dreamed of. Everything in such a narrow range of time, that some people experience the whole way from the last comun telegraph to the smart phone.
the history of computing could be seen as the sistematic progress to eliminate the neccesity of space .
The baggage machine could not be contructed because of his mechanichal nature, it occupyed too much space, and some of the space that it should ocuppy were in need for pieces that we were simply not able to produce by then. 
World war 2 pushed the need to abandon mechanichal computing and gave birth to the firsts electronical computers, and altough by then computers still ocupyed a considerable space, less than 30 years later we had portable ones.




twenty years ago
is the visual editors the ones that should be talking with the internet, not trought a transletion to html protocol, but a new protocol, some especie of multidimentional-pure-svg lenguaje, in which we can code thinking from spaces and not from the element-especific-placement of html. The main protocol for internet comunication should be design on the basis of visuals, that is to say that primarly shoud be coding some kind of topografic data, close to a game engine.
